 * This is a design document for the signal interface Mobility Management (MM/GMM/UMM)
 * and 3GPP Radio Resource Control (URRC) for Mediatek's 3GPP (3rd Generation
 * Partnership Project) product. The interface between URRC and MM is
 * known as the RRC interface shown in this \ref PSInterfaceFigure
 * It describes the signals sent between these two entities in terms of data
 * structures and data values, and provides a summary of the purpose of each
 * signal, when it may be expected to occur, and how it relates to other
 * signals on the same interface.
 *
 * The Mobility Management entity of the protocol stack embodies three elements,
 * the Mobility Management functionality for GSM (MM), that for GPRS (GMM) and
 * that for 3GPP (UMM).
 *
 * This document refers to the Mobility Management entity as MM throughout,
 * meaning the above functionality taken as a whole, unless it is necessary
 * to indicate functionality specific to one of the above systems.
 *
 * The Radio Resource functionality referred to by this document is that
 * for the 3GPP Radio Resource Control (RRC) entity which is referred to as RRC.
 *
 * This document incorporates requirements found in [3G TS 24.007].
